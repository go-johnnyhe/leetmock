	Short: "Instantly share your code editor with anyone, anywhere - no setup, just waveland start",
	Long: `waveland is a real-time collaborative coding tool designed for technical interviews and pair programming.
Share your code instantly with friends, colleagues, or interview partners without any setup or configuration.

Perfect for:
- Mock technical interviews with friends
- Remote pair programming sessions  
- Code reviews and debugging together
- Teaching and mentoring

How it works:
1. Start a session: waveland start main.py
2. Share the generated URL with your partner
3. They join with: waveland join <url>
4. Code together in real-time using your favorite editors

No accounts, no servers to manage, no complex setup - just pure collaborative coding.`,
