	Long: `waveland is a real-time collaborative coding tool designed for mock interviews and pair programming.
Share your code instantly with friends, colleagues, or interview partners without any setup or configuration.

How it works:
1. Go to your working directory and start a session: waveland start .
2. Share the generated URL with your partner
3. They join with: waveland join <url>
4. Code together in real-time using your favorite editors

No accounts, no servers to manage, no complex setup - just pure collaborative coding.`,
